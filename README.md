paramjs
=======

Validation system, that expect from you some rules (JSON-like-described) and if you want some custom data-type of input-param(s), a validation function for it.
If you need custom previewer for your form, you can create a custom template, but usually you can use theme-templates from us.

Param.js already supports a lot of data-types, and it's truly rare situation, when you need to add your own. Param.js works both at the client and at the server-side (node.js).


Documentation and code :) coming soon (in the next episode =) :)

PS Param.js originally developed for Omnicomm (http://omnicomm.ru).
